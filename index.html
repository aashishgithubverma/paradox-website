        <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="text">

        Paragliding is an adventurous sport that involves flying a lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
        aircraft. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing comprising a large number of interconnected
        cells. Unlike parachuting, which involves jumping from an aircraft, paragliding starts from a high point, such
        as a hill or mountain, and the pilot uses wind currents to stay aloft and navigate.
        <br />
        <br />
        Key Aspects of Paragliding:
        Equipment: <br>

        Wing (Canopy): Made of lightweight, durable fabric, it is designed to catch air and provide lift.
        Harness: The seat in which the pilot sits, offering comfort and safety.
        Helmet and Safety Gear: Essential for protection during takeoff, flight, and landing.
        Variometer: A device that measures the rate of ascent or descent, helping pilots find thermal updrafts to gain
        altitude.
